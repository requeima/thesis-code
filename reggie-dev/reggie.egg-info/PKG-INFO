Description: The goal of this package is to be a relatively self-contained python package
        for Bayesian regression problems. The predominant focus of this package, for
        the time-being is on Gaussian Process (GP) models, loosely based on Carl
        Rasmussen's `GPML` toolbox in matlab, however the focus has shifted slightly as
        we have tried to generalize some of these methods.
